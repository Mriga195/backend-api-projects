# Contact Management API

A comprehensive RESTful API for managing personal and professional contacts with user authentication, advanced search capabilities, and organizational features.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This contact management system allows users to store, organize, and efficiently retrieve contact information with proper security measures. Built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, it provides a robust backend solution for contact management applications.

## üõ† Technologies

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing
- **Rate Limiting**: express-rate-limit
- **Validation**: Custom middleware and Mongoose validators

## üìã Learning Objectives

- User authentication and authorization with JWT
- Password hashing and security best practices
- Text search implementation in MongoDB
- Rate limiting and API security measures
- Middleware chaining and error handling
- RESTful API design principles

## ‚è± Estimated Completion Time

**3-4 weeks** (depending on experience level and additional features implemented)

## üîí Security Features

### Password Security
- bcrypt hashing with salt rounds (minimum 12)
- Password strength requirements
- Secure password change functionality

### JWT Implementation
- Access tokens (short-lived, 15-30 minutes)
